#### Course Description

Computer-generated images are everywhere in movies, video games, and VR. This course is an introduction to the techniques to animate objects in computer graphics based on the law of physics. The aim of the course is to get familiar with applied mathematics such as linear algebra, vector analysis, partial differential equations, tensor mechanics, variational principle, optimization, and numerical analysis through the animation techniques for particle systems, rigid bodies, and elastic bodies. There are C#/Rust/Python programming assignments to acquire research-oriented graphics programming skills. The students also learn basics use of the computer graphics software Unity and Blender.

Topics:
- mass-spring simulation
- rigid body simulation
- elastic body simulation
- cloth and hair modeling & simulation
- collision-detection using spatial hashing
- finite boundary method

#### Policy

- Do the assignment by yourself. Don't share the assignments with others.
- Don't post the answers of the assignment on Slack 
- Late submission of an assignment is subject to grade deduction
- Score each assignment will not be open soon (instructor needs to adjust weights of the score later)
- You can use AIs tool for coding.
